We excitedly take on the responsibility of being the intermediary caretakers of the pieces we find and electronically restore them to them to their factory specifications. On occasion, on special pieces, we manipulate the wood, metal and electronics to create one of a kind audio art pieces intended to compliment both the mid century and current modern aesthetic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We value warmth, cherishing it in all its many iterations by transforming, refurbishing, and authenticating mid-century high-end audio equipment, lovingly and reverentially returning it to the same exacting standards by which it was created. Bringing back vintage audio&rsquo;s unique warmth and tone is no easy task, but capturing the vibe of America&rsquo;s mid-modern movement in the form of breathtaking audio equipment is why we exist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each piece of vintage gear has a story before it reaches our gallery, and our self-discovered duty is to rediscover those stories and pass them on to others, to add their own chapters as the years pass by.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","atb_text_alignment":"left","atb_text_size":"regular","atb_image":"","atb_image_position":"align-left","atb_image_height":"75vh","atb_color_bg":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)","atb_color_text":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","atb_gutter_enabled":""}]
